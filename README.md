YaaS: YaaS as a Service
=======================

YaaS as a Service is designed to allow you as a developer to provide scalable,
complete YaaS solutions to your users with low-cost service-based synergy.

YaaS as a Service will have the following options available:

1. YaaS streaming through websockets
------------------------------------
This inovative, Web 3.0 stream will
return YaaSes whenever the backend determines YaaSes need to be sent. When?
Only listening to the socket will allow you to know.

2. Traditional, HTTP GET YaaS
-----------------------------

If your application has not yet been extended to support websocket YaaSing,
YaaS can be used through traditional GET methods. Even if it's boring.

YaaSes sent through this endpoint will be timestamped with the exact moment the
YaaS came into existence, so your users can be sure their YaaSes are fresh.
